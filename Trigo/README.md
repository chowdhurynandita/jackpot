# Trigo
This is a simple java program that calculates and displays the value for an angle in degrees when used in a trigonometric function.
The program supports the following functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, and cosec.

## Usage
The program will prompt you to enter an input in the format of function angle, where function is one of the supported trigonometric functions and angle is an angle in degrees. For example, you can enter sin 60 or cot 45. The program will then calculate and display the value of the function for the given angle. For example, the output for sin 60 will be 0.866025 and the output for cot 45 will be 1.0.

## Example
Here are a few examples of how the program works:

Enter input: sin 30<br>
0.5

Enter input: cos 90<br>
0.0

Enter input: tan 45<br>
1.0
